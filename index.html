        <h2>Marking up Text in Blocks</h2>
        <p>When you have text that is displayed in a block,
             usually with multiple lines, it's considered a paragraph.
              Paragraph text can include words or phrases that are emphasized in some way, and they can contain links and other markup used for text (but not headings).
               Paragraphs are block-level elements.</p>
